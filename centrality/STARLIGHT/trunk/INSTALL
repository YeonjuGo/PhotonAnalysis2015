To build Starlight:

- First create your build directory (e.g. mkdir <PathToSource>/build)
- $ cd <BUILDDIR>
- $ cmake <PathToSource>
- $ make 

This creates an executable file, starlight, in the build directory. 

To run starlight a configuration file, slight.in, is needed. Examples of
this file can be found in the config/ directory.

To run:

$ ./starlight

If you want Pythia support you need to run cmake with an option:

$ cmake <PathToSource> -DENABLE_PYTHIA=ON

In addition the environment variable $PYTHIADIR needs to be pointing 
to the top directory of Pythia8.

P.S. Pythia is disables in this release 

//---------------------------------------------------

1) cd standard 
2) gmake/make 
3) ./starlight  


enjoy
