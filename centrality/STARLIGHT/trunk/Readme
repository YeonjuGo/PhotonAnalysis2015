The STARlight Monte Carlo models 2-photon and photon-Pomeron interactions
in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions. The physics approach for the photon-Pomeron 
interactions is described in Klein and Nystrand, Phys. Rev. C60, 014903 (1999),
with the p_t spectrum (including vector meson interference) discussed in Phys. Rev. 
Lett. 84, 2330 (2000). The 2-photon interactions are described in Baltz, Gorbunov, 
Klein, Nystrand, Phys.Rev. C80 (2009) 044902. 

STARlight has several input files, all of which are expected to be in the
same directory as the starlight code.  User-specified input parameters are
read from a file named "slight.in"; these parameters are described
below.

The output of the STARlight Monte Carlo will be written to an ascii file
named "slight.out".

Logs:

fixed types for class Particle 
- Int -> Double 
- fixed Makefile .. 
   autoconfig will appear in the future .. make sure paths are fixed before compiling 
   this is for includes and libraries in Makefile
- don't forget about link to pythia xml doc 
  This is located in main.cpp

- changed PID of the charged KAON to 321 and neutral kaon to 310 .. it should work now for phi -> kk
